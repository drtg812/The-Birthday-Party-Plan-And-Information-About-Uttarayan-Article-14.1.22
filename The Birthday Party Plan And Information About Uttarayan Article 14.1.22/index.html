        <h1><marquee>The Birthday Party Plan And Information About Uttarayan</marquee></h1><hr>
        <h2>Hey! Do you know, today is my cousin sister- Suhani's birthday! Today, she completed 6! It's my uncle's birthday also today, and also, it's Uttarayan- The Kite Flying Festival(Also called Makar Sakranti)🪁🪁! 3 in 1 special days package! But the funniest thing is, I don't know how to fly kites!🤣🤣. Our neighbors will come at our house, celebrate the party, cut the cake, and have dinner and they will return to their home. I am excited about the party, after I got to know the whole plan! Aren't you?<br><br><br>
            Now discussing Uttarayan, it is a significant festival dedicated to Lord Surya or the Sun God. It is celebrated on Jan 14, days become longer and nights become shorter, marking the end of the winter season. When the question comes to "Who started Makar Sakranti", it is believed that Sakranti, after whom the festival is named, was a deity who killed a demon called Sankarasur. On the day of Makar Sakranti, called Karidin or Kinkrant, the Devi killed Kinkarasur. This is also the time when the sun begins to move to the North direction.
            Conclusion- I don't know whether you're excited about the party or not, but I'll tell you more about the party in the next one...</h2>
